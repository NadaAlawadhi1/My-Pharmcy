# 🚀 My Pharmcy Flutter App — Actively in Development

This is a ** Pharmcy application** built with **Flutter (Clean Architecture + GetX)** and connected to a **PHP + MySQL backend** with **Firebase integrations**.  

The **frontend** is fully structured and functional, while the **backend** is being developed separately and integrated step by step.
